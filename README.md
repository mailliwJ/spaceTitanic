# Space Titanic ML Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predct whether a passenger was transported off of a spaceship in a simulated diasaster event. The primary objective is to achieve a classification accuracy of over 80% on the prediction dataset. Through this project i aim to deepen my understanding of scikit-learn, and develop custom classes and functions for use in future machine learning workflows.

## Problem Statement

The problem is a binary classification task, in which the model predicts the liklihood of a passenger being transported off of a spaceship in a freak disaster event, based on various passenger-related features.

## Project Goals

1. Build a classification model that achieves over 80% accuracy on the prediction dataset
2. Develop and use custom classes and functions to structure machine learning projects for efficient preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation
