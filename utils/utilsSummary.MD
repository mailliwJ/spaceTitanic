## Summary of Utilities

A sideline goal for this project was to continue the development of two previous projects, VizToolz and MLToolz, and use this scenario to test the functions in these modules.

Please see the repos for these modules:
- [VizToolz](https://github.com/mailliwJ/VizToolz)
- [MLToolz](https://github.com/mailliwJ/MLToolz)

A number of other functions and classes were created during the cleaning stage of this project as part of my imputation strategy. While this project aims to make use of a pipeline that handles imputations as part of preprocessing, the notebook [imputationStrategy.ipynb]() details my thought processes around the development of this strategy and the functions used to carry it out. This notebook also provides a brief demonstration of how the code is functional and can lead to a clean and fully imputed dataset, which is then saved in src/data/processed.
